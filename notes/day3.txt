Primitive Types		-> not share state with other primitive values.
	1. Boolean Type
	2. Numeric Types -> Integral Types	and 	Floating-point Types
						- byte	(8-bit)			- float 	(32-bit)
						- short	(16-bit)		- double	(64-bit)
						- int 	(32-bit)
						- long 	(64-bit)
						- char	(16-bit)

Reference Types
	1. Class types
	2. Interface types
	3. Type variables
	4. Array types

Special null Type -> impossible to declare or cast to null type, be ignored for a special literal of any reference type.

Boolean Type and Values
literals ==> true and false

Boolean Operators
1. the relational operators == and !=
2. the logical complement operator !
3. the logical operators &, ^ and |
4. the conditional-and and conditional-or operators => && and ||
5. the conditional operaotr => ? :
6. the string concatenation operator => +

Boolean expression determine the control flow in several kinds of statements

Integral Types and Values
range = [-2^n-1, 2^(n-1)-1]
char => from '\u0000' to '\uffff' inclusive that is from 0 to 65535

Integer Operations
1. the comparison operators
2. the numerical operators
3. the conditional operator => ? :
4. the cast operator
5. the string concatenation operator => +

Integer Operator can throw
	1. NullPointerException
	2. ArithmeticException
	3. OutOfMemoryError

Floating-Point Operations
1. the comparison operators
2. the numerical operators
3. the conditional operator
4. the cast operator
5. the string concatenation operator

Floating-point operator can throw
	1. NullPointerException
	2. OutOfMemoryError
